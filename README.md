💡 Challenge or Insight

the main challenge during the process was the lack of time. also making the table flex display for the statistics i will be working on that on the next stage.

💡 Challenge or Insight

Styling the charts to match the dashboard’s minimalist and modern look was a key challenge. I had to learn how to customize ApexCharts’ config options for color, tooltip styling, and responsive behavior. It was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of data visualization in a UI context.
